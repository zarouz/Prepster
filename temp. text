flask cleanup-unconfirmed-users
Important: For this cleanup to happen automatically,
 you need to set up a scheduler (like cron on macOS/Linux or Task Scheduler on Windows) 
 to run the flask cleanup-unconfirmed-users command periodically 
 (e.g., every minute or every 5 minutes).
  This setup is outside the scope of the application code itself.
